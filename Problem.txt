8. Use Case : 

Interview Scheduling Automation
Customer Requirement Statement

We have a large volume of job applicants in our system, and their
statuses need to be updated regularly based on various criteria. For
example, applicants who haven't been updated in 30 days should be
moved to an "Inactive" status, and those who have been interviewed
but not advanced should be marked as "Not Selected." Currently, this
process is manual and time-consuming, leading to inconsistencies and
outdated applicant information.

We need an automated batch job that can efficiently update applicant
statuses based on predefined rules. This will help us maintain
accurate records, improve reporting, and ensure a streamlined
recruitment process.

Functional Requirements
• Status Updates: The batch job should update the "Status" field on
the Applicant object based on the following rules:
o Applicants with no activity (e.g., no status changes,
interviews, or communications) for 30 days should be
marked as "Inactive."

o Applicants who have been interviewed but haven't
progressed to the next stage within 14 days of the
interview should be marked as "Not Selected."

o Applicants who have communicated that they are no
longer interested , and has been recorded as a checkbox
on candidate record, their status needs to be updated to
“Withdrawn”


Technical Requirements
• Batch Apex: The solution should be implemented using Batch Apex to handle large volumes of applicant records efficiently.
 The batch job should be scheduled to run on a regular
• Scheduling: The batch job should be scheduled to run on a regular basis (e.g., nightly or weekly) to keep applicant statuses up-to-date.
• Query Optimization: The batch job should use efficient SOQL queries to retrieve and process applicant records.
• Error Handling: The batch job should include robust error handling mechanisms to manage exceptions and prevent data corruption.

Additional Considerations
• Configuration: The batch job should be configurable to allow administrators to modify the status update rules and schedule as
needed. (Use custom Metadata for the configuration).
• Performance: The batch job should be optimized for performance to minimize execution time and resource consumption.
• Testing: Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure the batch job functions correctly and meets all requirements.
